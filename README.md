# trackpad_
This Python code uses the `pynput` library to track mouse activity, including movement, clicks, and scrolls. The `MouseTracker` class captures the mouse position, button clicks, and scroll actions. The `process` method monitors position changes, displaying updates in the console at set intervals, all while running in a separate thread.
